Subject: [PATCH] Use dex-autostart to run xdg desktop files

We set dex to run all the desktop files for XFCE as there
are some things we do want (in particular xscreensaver) that are
listed as XFCE only. It may start some things that are not needed,
(eg xfsettingsd) but this does not seem to cause a problem.
